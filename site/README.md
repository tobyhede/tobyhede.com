## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🎨 Theme and Dark Mode

This site includes a custom dark mode implementation:

- **Default**: Dark mode is enabled by default for all visitors
- **Theme Toggle**: Click the sun/moon icon in the footer to switch themes
- **Persistence**: Your theme preference is saved in browser localStorage
- **FOUC Prevention**: Theme loads before page render to prevent flash of unstyled content

The theme system uses CSS variables defined in `src/styles/global.css`. Colors automatically adjust when switching between light and dark modes.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
