  - Thesis
  - Antithesis
  - Synthesis

⏺ Interesting thought! The Hegelian dialectic could frame it nicely:

  | Current    | Hegelian          | Meaning                                                    |
  |------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Common     | Synthesis         | Where both reviewers converged (resolved agreement)        |
  | Exclusive  | Thesis/Antithesis | Unique positions from each reviewer                        |
  | Divergence | Contradiction     | Positions that directly oppose (resolved during collation) |

  But the mapping is imperfect - Hegel's dialectic assumes opposing forces that resolve into synthesis. Our model is more about:
  1. Agreement (common) - no dialectic tension
  2. Unique insight (exclusive) - not opposition, just different coverage
  3. Opposition (divergence) - actual contradiction

```

And yes, I know that Hegel never used the terms `Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis` in his dialectical method.
Don't @ me.
